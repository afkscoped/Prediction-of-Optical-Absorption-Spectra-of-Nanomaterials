1. We have 21 subfolders, each with a name corresponding to one of the 21 patchy nanoparticles (NPs) listed in Supplementary Table 1 of the paper “Patchy Nanoparticles by Atomic “Stencilling” (2025)."

2. In transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the bright and dark regions indicate the polymer patches and NP cores, respectively.

3. In scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, the bright and dark regions indicate the NP cores and polymer patches, respectively.

4. Each subfolder contains a “readme (subfolder name).txt” file with more detailed information about each sample.
